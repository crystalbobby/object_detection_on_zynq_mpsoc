# Example SD-card


The sd-card includes everything to the implementation on a sample image that is also in the directory. The username/password of the linux is root/root and the executable file is obj_det_from_file.elf. The directory where the sd-card is mounted is '/media'. The program will output an output image called img_out.bin again in binary format containing the image with the respective bounding boxes.
